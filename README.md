Artwork categorization PHP web application that uses user input emotional ratings and image processing 
as comparison metrics.  
  -Testing absolute difference algorithm, which simulates Robert Plutchik's emotion wheel. The algorithm is
  less computationally expensive than Euclidean distance for this function, but results are uncertain. Currently
  populating the database and having users vote on emotions evoked to test effectiveness.
  -Also uses modified Euclidean distance for finding matches to compare results to the Plutchik algorithm.
